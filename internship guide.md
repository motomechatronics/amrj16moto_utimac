# Internship Description  
## ROS2 Simulation & Tutorial Development for Autonomous Mobile Robot

**Company:** MOTO Mechatronics  
**Platform:** TheConstruct.ai  
**Reference Repository:**  
https://github.com/motomechatronics/amrj16moto_utimac

---

## 1. Internship Goal

The goal of this internship is to train the candidate in **ROS2-based mobile robotics** through a structured learning path that combines:

- selected courses on **TheConstruct.ai**,
- hands-on work on a **realistic robot simulation environment**,
- the production of **high-quality, reproducible technical tutorials**.

The internship outcome is not only technical learning, but also the creation of **clear and reliable educational material** that can be reused by other students or team members.

---

## 2. Learning Path – TheConstruct Courses

During the internship, the candidate is required to follow and complete selected courses on **TheConstruct.ai**, including (but not limited to):

- ROS2 in 5 Days (Python)
- ROS2 Basics (nodes, topics, messages)
- ROS2 Services and Actions
- ROS2 URDF/XACRO
- ROS2 Navigation (Nav2)
- Simulation with Gazebo / Ignition

These courses provide the theoretical and practical background necessary to develop the requested tutorials.

---

## 3. Reference Simulation Environment (Mandatory)

All internship activities **must be based on the AMRJ16MOTO robot simulation environment**, available at:

At the moment, the simulation environment is functional; however, **a mandatory part of the internship consists in updating and aligning it with:**

- **ROS2 Humble**
- **Gazebo Ignition**

This update activity is considered an **integral part of the internship tasks** and must be completed before (or during) the development of the tutorials.

---

## 4. What the Candidate Is Required To Do

### 4.1 Environment Update

- Analyze the current state of the AMRJ16MOTO simulation
- Update packages, launch files, and configurations to be fully compatible with:
  - ROS2 Humble
  - Gazebo Ignition
- Verify that the simulation builds and runs correctly on a clean system

---

### 4.2 Tutorial Development (Core Activity)

The candidate must produce a series of **technical tutorials**, inspired by the Husarion ROS2 tutorial structure, covering the following topics:

1. ROS2 Introduction, installation & Workspace Setup  
2. Creating Nodes (Messages, Services, Actions)  
3. Robot Modeling with URDF & Xacro  
   - including **conditional Xacro**  
4. Simulation Environment Modeling with Gazebo Ignition  
5. TF2 & Robot Kinematics  
6. SLAM  
7. Navigation with Nav2  
8. Recovery Behaviors and Impasse Handling (ex. lose one's position, etc). 

---

## 5. Tutorial Reference Constraint (Critical Requirement)

**All tutorials must explicitly and exclusively refer to the AMRJ16MOTO simulation environment.**

This means that:

- all commands,
- all launch files,
- all configuration files,
- all screenshots and examples

**must be consistent with the updated AMRJ16MOTO repository** and tested within that environment.

Generic examples not connected to the reference simulation are **not acceptable**.

---

## 6. Reproducibility & Quality Standard

A tutorial is considered **complete and acceptable** only if:

- another student, starting from a clean computer, is able to:
  - clone the repository,
  - follow the tutorial step by step,
  - build the workspace,
  - launch the simulation,
  - reproduce the described behavior without errors.

This reproducibility requirement is **a fundamental quality criterion**.

A tutorial that cannot be replicated by another student is considered **incomplete**, regardless of its theoretical correctness.

In this context, the tutorial itself represents **proof that the learning objective has been achieved** and that the knowledge has been correctly transferred.

---

## 7. Expected Deliverables

- Updated AMRJ16MOTO simulation (ROS2 Humble + Gazebo Ignition)
- A complete set of tutorials written in Markdown
- Tested launch files and configuration files
- Clear instructions and validation steps for each tutorial
- A final summary report

---

## 8. Evaluation Criteria

The internship will be evaluated based on:

- correctness and robustness of the updated simulation environment,
- clarity, structure, and completeness of the tutorials,
- strict reproducibility of all examples,
- coherence between tutorials and simulation,
- overall technical understanding demonstrated.

---

This internship is designed to ensure that the candidate not only learns ROS2, but also develops the ability to **produce reliable, high-quality technical documentation**, a key skill in professional robotics development.
